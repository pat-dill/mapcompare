# multimap

This is a website utilizing MapboxGL to let you compare the sizes of cities & countries. Two globes are shown, which can be
panned independently, but always match zoom.

As Mapbox transitions to a Mercator projection as you zoom in, the zoom level of each globe is automatically adjusted based on 
latitude to reduce distortion.
